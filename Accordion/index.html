            behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.

            React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building 
            user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta and a 
            community of individual developers and companies. React can be used to 
            develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with 
            frameworks like Next.js.

            Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on 
            Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript 
            runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes 
            JavaScript code outside a web browser.
